To run the program enter either Minor or Patch followed by a path to a valid json file. 
This file must be can be stored under the patchLog folder although any path to a json file with the 
required fields will work. The provided file was missing a comma after Version and this was corrected 
before the file could be used

FURTHER IDEAS: 
With additional time the json file could be set to an object with methods for reading fields. 
Unit tests could check for 
	- key errors 
	- correctly parsing files
